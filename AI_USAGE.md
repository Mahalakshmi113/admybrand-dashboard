# 🤖 AI Usage Documentation  

This project was developed with the assistance of **AI coding tools** (ChatGPT by OpenAI) to accelerate development and improve quality.  

## 📌 How AI was used
- **Project Setup** → Guidance on configuring Next.js with Tailwind/Bootstrap.  
- **Code Generation** → Helped scaffold the dashboard layout and chart components.  
- **API Integration** → Suggested use of Fake Store API & JSONPlaceholder for realistic mock data.  
- **UI/UX Improvements** → Recommended design patterns, responsive layouts, and dark/light mode.  
- **Export Features** → Provided implementation details for CSV (Papaparse) and PDF (jsPDF).  
- **Debugging** → Assisted in resolving errors with Tailwind v4, Next.js configs, and GitHub workflow.  

## ⚖️ Compliance
- AI was used as a **coding assistant** only.  
- All final implementation, testing, and validation were done by the developer (**Mahalakshmi B R**).  
- The project remains original, and AI contributions are transparently documented.
